Abstract: The pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is regulated by various miRNAs. In this study, we identified that miR-875-5pis up-regulated in NSCLC patients, and inhibited SATB Homeobox 2(SATB2) to promote proliferation and invasion of NSCLCcells.CCK-8assay revealed thatmiR-875-5p mimics promoted proliferation of NSCLC cells. Transwell assay showed that miR-875-5pmimicspromoted the invasion and migration of NSCLC cells. Luciferase assays confirmed that miR-875-5pdirectly binds to the 3'untranslated region of SATB2, and western blotting showed that miR-875-5psuppresses the expression of SATB2 at the protein level. Moreover, the inhibitors of miR-875-5pinhibit proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cell lines. The miR-875-5pwouldbe a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment in the future.
